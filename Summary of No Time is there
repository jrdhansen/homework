### Summary - No time is there and why things appear to be speeding up

This was a pretty interesting presentation, it was very non-linear, and for what was essentially a history lesson, I really enjoyed it. History is pretty non-linear generally speaking. I did enjoy learning about John Von Neumann architecture and about 40 bits being a combination of a command and an address. <br/>    

One of the biggest takeaways I had was about noise and the distance between signals. This came from Julian Bigelow and Norbert Wienerâ€™s research predicting the path of planes in order to shoot them down with anti air craft. A big part of there work had to do with distinguishing signals, and this was essential for the computer working later on. This principle about noise also has some huge implications for finance because the real world isnâ€™t elegant and can be perfectly described by a formulaâ€¦ its messy, noisy. Computers essentially allow us to shorten the distance between signals this is why a Monte Carlo simulation is so cool, it allows us to decipher the noise from the true signal.    <br/>

I recently re-watched The Imitation Game (a film about Alan Turing breaking the  German Enigma code), and this clip reinforced what that shared: Computers allow us to change the time scale at which we operate, and time becomes less and less of a factor. The powerful example that the clip gave was the capacity to test the life span of stars as well as the moments of a nuclear reaction.    <br/>

Von Neumann spoke, during his time at Los Alamos about how he was â€œthinking about something much more important than bombs, I'm thinking about computers" He envisioned that someday numbers would not just mean things, but to do things as well.
