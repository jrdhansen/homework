## What Should Computational Economists Do?

This question stems somewhat from James Buchanan’s speech on the subject of "What should economists do?" and touches a lot of what it means to be an economist today. There are a lot of different things that an Economist could be doing. Buchanan talks about how there is a lack of emphasis on markets, and an overemphasis on optimizing utility constraints, he talks about how economics, partly because of Buchanan’s own work in public choice, has departed from its fundamental focus on markets.

In this paper I endeavor to answer the question: What should Computational Economists do? I don’t pretend to have perfect answers to such a complex question, and I have four main thoughts: 

-  Economists should focus on arbitrage.
-  Economists should focus on the informational role of markets.
-  Economists should embrace the noise and the fuzziness of real markets, and use computers to decipher meaning. 
-  Economists should use open source and machine learning to innovate new models that better explain the world around us and don’t simplify away the true complexity of markets and public choice problems.

### Exchange, Trade and Arbitrage

Markets are a magical thing, I recall my first Econ 1500 class, and learning about Adam Smith’s “Invisible Hand”. The earth-shattering idea that a bunch of people exchanging in self-interest would magically allocate resources where they belong and make everyone better off whisked my life into a new direction, and I switched my major because it was fascinating. 

After that though, Economics classes grew less and less exciting as we departed from what James Buchanan calls “Catallactics” or the study of exchange. Study became all about optimizing utility functions and solving the production function and studying tariffs and taxes. By the way, all of that study was valuable and interesting in its own right, and did have a little bit to do with markets, but markets never were at the heart of the matter after that first class. 

My study of markets has been a little limited as a result of this, but I get to observe cool arbitrage opportunities in the real market all the time. Recently, I am working on an algorithm to pull down potential buy and sell deals from Amazon with webscraping. The spreads when you get wholesale accounts are sometimes seventy percent and if you choose wisely then you can get some products that just fly off the shelves. If Computational Economists were to focus more on arbitrage opportunities like this, their time would be much better spent. One area of specific interest is studying the evolution of new markets, how do you gauge demand for a product that doesn’t yet exist? Or will exist in a new form? The development of some intuitive science around those emerging markets would be engaging.

Clearly, by virtue of my own experience as well, the study of markets and prices is much more central to economics than the status quo would indicate. Economists should focus on exchange, trade and arbitrage.

### The Informational Role of Markets

My favorite academic paper is by Richard Roll. His work described the informational role of prices in a powerful way. The traders predicted information about weather in a more precise way than the weathermen did. They anticipated freezes and heavy rainfall more efficiently becuase it was predictive of the value of orange futures. Justin Wolfers from the Wharton school recently wrote a paper about predictive and pseudo-markets. He wrote:

> "these markets efficiently aggregate disperse information, and the lessons from empirical applications which show that market generated forecasts typically outperform most moderately sophisticated benchmarks"

There are a few real psuedo-markets that have emerged and have proven very predictive. Campaign prediction markets like www.predictit.org do pretty well at forecasting outcomes. With the evolution of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies like BitCoin, it is clear that predictive and psuedo-markets are the way of the future for computational economists.

### Embracing the Noise and Fuzziness of Markets
As I watched the talk by George Dyson, there were quite a few things that struck me, one of which was the idea that computers alter our fundamental construct of time because they allow us to much observations at iterations impossible at a normal time scale: Observe the lifetime of a star, project biological processes, understand the inner workings of nuclear reactions. Finance and markets introduce a noise and a fuzziness problem in the real world, which computers can also help us to decipher. Computational Economists should use computers to decipher meaning through the noise.

One of the ways to decipher meaning through the noise that we are learning about in class is the Monte Carlo study. Pseudo random numbers can be used to represent the natural volatility and fuzziness of the market and as you run hundreds of thousands of trials, you begin to see a trend, a model that converges somewhat closely to the true price.

In George Dyson’s talk there was another comment about noise: john von Neumann and the other engineers faced a serious problem, some of the receptors in the Eniac (one of the first computers) were particularly receptive and picked up a lot of noise, in addition to the dots and dashes it was being fed. The solution was to shorten the distance from signal to receptor, and reduce the noise. Monte Carlo studies allow us to do just this.

If Friederich Hayek, the famed Economist, is to be believed, then prices and markets do an incredible job of conveying information. After all, he is an Austrian, and since I lived in Vienna for two years, I trust him. If that is true, then one of the prerogatives of the Computational Economist is to embrace the noise of the market and find meaning anyways using these great tools we have in random number generators and computers that keep getting  faster and faster.

### Using Open Source to Innovate New Models to Better Explain the World
Professor Tyler Brough of Utah State shared a great story the other day in lecture that illustrates the idea that we have poor models pretty p. In order to model the profitability of hedging practices, some professors made some assumptions. Their assumptions about perfect competition and perfect information literally assumed away the possibility of an arbitrage opportunity with this hedging practice. They fixed the race. Any testing they did would just prove their assumptions.

In order to better understand the real world, we need to stop assuming away the true nature of the world, which is fuzzy and messy. If we embrace the complicated nature of the world around us, maybe we can start to find some new innovated answers to the questions we all need answers to, and that we may not have considered to ask just yet.

As occurred with the Black Scholes Model (i.e. the most robust in Finance), cross functional collaborations are essential to progress. Just as Merten provided some essential mathematics that was unfamiliar to Black and Scholes, there are numerous examples of cross functional learning that have transformed science. The world of open source is here. Using the tools of the open source world will prove absolutely essential to driving new success in the science of finance.

There are countless examples of machine learning and AI enhancing the models we use to understand the world. It has been used in genetics and biology in miraculous ways (Goldberg). Professor Tyler Brough even talked about machine learning creating a better real estate model. Machine learning can take sparse data about defaults and create a better risk profile for a given mortgage. Machine learning can help us to better forecast the real world. As AI develops, it will have a phenomenal impact on finance.

Computational Economists have incredible tools in the computer to run a gazillion simulations to better understand the real world of markets. They have the capacity to tweak their assumptions and better understand how their assumptions drive their model. As they do so, and as they should, Computational Economists will continue to innovate better models that do a better job of striking at the heart of what is really going on.

### Summary
Again, I don’t really pretend to know all the answers, but it’s clear to me that Computational Economists aren’t even really trying to answer the questions they should be. Economics is the study of “the propensity to truck, barter and exchange one thing for another” (Adam Smith), and it is folly to think that we know all there is to know about it. In particular, delving into the study of the creation of new markets has some potentially fascinating answers.

Prediction and psuedo-markets are a huge area that computational economists need to innovate in and study. They may even want to consider creating new "idea" markets in order to understand the informational value of prices to a better degree and understand its limitations.

Computational Economists can glean some enormous insights into the true nature of exchange as they embrace the fuzziness and messiness of the real world. They now have tools they haven’t had before to begin working on these problems. Random number generators from a myriad of different distributions, insane amounts of computing power at their fingertips, it’s not time to be shy about trying out new things, and using to power of open source, machine learning and AI to tap into the knowledge that other disciplines have to offer. 

Nowadays, algorithm driven trades comprise a large chunk of the transactions in the market. It’s time that Computational Economists take a deeper look and use technology to create better models of what is really going on in the world of trade. Our world.
